# HackHPC20_TrafficVision
TrafficVision project for data visualization and analytics the Atlanta area

## Problem Statement

* With an abundance of data detailing traffic related incidents from TrafficVision, what type of analysis and visualizations can be provided to best inform local DOT’s allocation of resources to best keep traffic running safely and efficiently

* Information for the State of Tennessee but the program will be able to work with data from Georgia’s TrafficVision installation.

* Question asked: How can we(the programmers) help TNDOT/GDOT visualize their data and allocate their resources?

## Project Goals

* Creating data visualizations from traffic analytics to better inform decision making of the TNDOT/GDOT

* Focus on a heat map of stand still traffic to inform location of HERO trucks
